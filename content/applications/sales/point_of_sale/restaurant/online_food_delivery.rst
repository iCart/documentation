Enable the connector
--------------------

#. Go to the :ref:`POS settings <pos/use/settings>`.
#. Scroll down to the :guilabel:`Food Delivery Connector` section.

#. In the :guilabel:`Food Delivery Store` field, select an existing store or create one from
   :menuselection:`Point of Sale --> Configuration --> UrbanPiper --> Stores`.

UrbanPiper store
----------------

Each point of sale is linked to a dedicated UrbanPiper store record that centralizes credentials,
aggregators, pricing, and schedule-related settings.

#. Go to :menuselection:`Point of Sale --> Configuration --> UrbanPiper --> Stores`.
#. Click :guilabel:`New`.
#. On the store form:

   #. Enter a :guilabel:`Name`.
   #. Select the :guilabel:`Point of Sale` that will receive online orders.
   #. Keep the generated :guilabel:`POS Store ID`, unless UrbanPiper instructs you to use a
      specific value.
   #. Select a :guilabel:`Preset`.
   #. Set the :guilabel:`Preparation Time`.
   #. Optionally upload an :guilabel:`Order Notification Sound` in `.mp3` format.
   #. If the company is based in India, choose the appropriate :guilabel:`Tax Type`.
#. Open the :guilabel:`Credentials` tab and enter your :ref:`UrbanPiper credentials
   <online_food_delivery/credentials>`.
#. Open the :guilabel:`Aggregators` tab and add one line per delivery platform.

   - Use :guilabel:`Pricelist` to apply platform-specific pricing during menu synchronization.
   - Disable :guilabel:`Create Customer` if Odoo should not create customer records for orders
     coming from that aggregator.

#. Open the :guilabel:`Store Info` tab and confirm the :guilabel:`City`.
#. Save, then click :guilabel:`Create Store`.

.. note::
   - A point of sale can only be linked to one UrbanPiper store.

     :guilabel:`Update Store`.
   - Store creation may take 2 to 3 minutes to appear in UrbanPiper Atlas.

#. Select or create a preset dedicated to online food delivery.
#. Configure the preset as needed:

   - Set the default :guilabel:`Pricelist`.
   - Set the default :guilabel:`Fiscal Position`.
   - If needed, enable :guilabel:`Manage orders by time` and configure the :guilabel:`Schedule`.

#. Assign the preset to the UrbanPiper store.

.. tip::
   Restaurant databases include an :guilabel:`Online Delivery` preset by default.

   .. note::
      To find the location's :guilabel:`Platform ID` and :guilabel:`Platform URL`:

      #. Click the location to open its setup form.
      #. Open the :guilabel:`HUB` tab.

      status for the location.

Order flow
==========

When a customer places an order through a configured delivery platform, Odoo sends a notification.
To manage the order:

#. Click :guilabel:`Review Orders` on the notification popup, or click the bag-shaped online-order
   icon and then :guilabel:`New`.

   .. image:: online_food_delivery/cart-button.png
      :alt: Cart button

   .. note::
      - The icon displays the number of orders in :guilabel:`New`, :guilabel:`Ongoing`, and
        :guilabel:`Done`.
      - :guilabel:`New` contains newly placed orders, :guilabel:`Ongoing` contains accepted
        orders, and :guilabel:`Done` contains orders ready to be delivered.

#. Select the order.
#. Click :guilabel:`Accept`.
#. When the order is accepted, its :guilabel:`Order Status` changes from :guilabel:`Placed` to
   :guilabel:`Acknowledged`.

If a :doc:`preparation display <../extra/preparation>` is configured, the accepted order is also
sent there automatically.

When the order is ready:

#. Open the orders list.
#. Select the order.
#. Click :guilabel:`Mark as ready`.
#. The :guilabel:`Order Status` changes from :guilabel:`Acknowledged` to :guilabel:`Food Ready`,
   and the order's :guilabel:`Status` changes from :guilabel:`Ongoing` to :guilabel:`Paid`.

.. tip::
   To review online orders from the backend, go to :menuselection:`Point of Sale --> Orders -->
   Orders` and use the :guilabel:`Online Food Delivery` filter.

Order rejection
---------------

To reject an order:

#. Open the orders list.
#. Select the order.
#. Click :guilabel:`Reject`.
#. Select a reason in the popup window.

.. image:: online_food_delivery/reject-order.png
   :alt: Reject order pop-up

.. important::
   **Swiggy** orders cannot be directly rejected. Attempting to reject one prompts Swiggy customer
   support to contact the restaurant. Similarly, **Deliveroo**, **Just Eat**, and
   **HungerStation** do not allow order rejection. Always follow the respective provider's
   guidelines for handling such cases.
